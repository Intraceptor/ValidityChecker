# ValidityChecker
Validity Checker for Propositional Logic

Fully functional for AND and IF statements, partially functional for OR statements. Variables can be of any length.

BUGS:
 - Does not function for statements longer than 1 connective (failed to make nested statements work accurately).
 - Having more than 1 conclusion creates inconsistencies in the validation

Some bugs are present regarding the validity of OR statements
